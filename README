Hello. this is shiwoo Park

First of all, thanks for using my 'date_handler' python module.

This module is created for parsing and normalizing date strings to get standardized form of date data
You can retrieve unix-timestamp or 'YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM:SS' formatted date data from it.
Also, you can decide the output date format by using python date format (please check python documentation)

If you find any error or bug, please contact me by email below
